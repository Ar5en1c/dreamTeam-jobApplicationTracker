CREATE EXTENSION vector;

-- Job embeddings table
CREATE TABLE job_embeddings (
  job_id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding vector(1536),
  created_at timestamp
);

-- Similarity search
SELECT job_id, 1 - (embedding <=> query_vector) as similarity
FROM job_embeddings
ORDER BY embedding <=> query_vector
LIMIT 10;
```

**Cost**: Included in Supabase Pro ($25/month)

---

#### 4. **Puppeteer / Playwright** (WEB SCRAPING)
**Use Cases**:
- Job portal data extraction (when no API)

- Login automation (with user consent)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Example: LinkedIn Easy Apply automation
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

async function autoApply(jobUrl: string, userData: UserProfile) {
  const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
  const page = await browser.newPage();

  await page.goto(jobUrl);
  await page.click('button:has-text("Easy Apply")');

  // Fill form fields
  await page.fill('[name="firstName"]', userData.name.first);
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', userData.email);

  // Handle multi-page forms
  while (await page.isVisible('button:has-text("Next")')) {
    await page.click('button:has-text("Next")');
    await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
  }

  // Submit (with user confirmation)
  await page.click('button:has-text("Submit")');
  await browser.close();
}

  payment_behavior: 'default_incomplete',
  expand: ['latest_invoice.payment_intent'],
});

// Usage-based billing (AI credits)
await stripe.subscriptionItems.createUsageRecord(
  subscriptionItemId,
  { quantity: 10, action: 'increment' } // 10 AI resume tailorings
);
```

**Pricing**:
- 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction

## 💡 PART 10: COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES & MOATS

### What Makes Us Different (Defensible Moats)

#### **1. All-in-One Platform** (Network Effects)
**Advantage**: Users want ONE tool, not 5 tools
- Tracking + AI + Automation in single platform
- Data flows between features (resume → applications → insights)
- Switching costs increase over time (more data = more value)

**Moat Strength**: Strong (12-18 months to replicate)

---

#### **2. Superior User Experience** (Brand)
**Advantage**: Professional UI that users love
- Glassmorphism design (modern, premium feel)
- 140KB bundle (faster than competitors)
- Mobile-first, accessibility compliant

**Moat Strength**: Medium (can be copied, but requires talent)

---

#### **3. Ethical Automation** (Trust)
**Advantage**: Transparent, user-controlled automation
- Competitors hide automation (black box)
- We show exactly what we do
- User approves each application
- No spam, no mass-applying to irrelevant jobs

**Moat Strength**: Strong (builds long-term brand trust)

---

#### **4. Data-Driven Insights** (Data Network Effects)
**Advantage**: More users = better insights
- Salary benchmarks (aggregated anonymously)
- Application success rates by company/role
- Best times to apply, optimal follow-up timing
- Job market trends

**Moat Strength**: Very Strong (compounds over time)

---

#### **5. Freemium + Transparent Pricing** (Go-to-Market)
**Advantage**: Lower barrier to entry than competitors
- $9.99 vs $79-129/month competitors
- Free tier for basic tracking (viral growth)
- Clear value at each tier (no hidden fees)

**Moat Strength**: Medium (can be copied, but we have first-mover advantage)

---

#### **6. Developer-Friendly APIs** (Platform)
**Advantage**: Future ecosystem of integrations
- Public API for extensions (Chrome, Firefox)
- Webhook integrations (Zapier, n8n)
- Career coach partnerships (white-label)
- University integrations (SSO)

**Moat Strength**: Strong (ecosystem is hard to replicate)

---

### Risks & Mitigation

#### **Risk 1: LinkedIn/Indeed Changes TOS** (HIGH)
**Impact**: Auto-apply features may break
**Mitigation**:
- Build on official APIs where available
- Maintain manual tracking as core product
- Diversify to smaller job boards (less restrictive)
- User-controlled automation (not bot-like)

---

#### **Risk 2: Competitor Copies Features** (MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Feature parity, price war
**Mitigation**:
- Focus on user experience (hard to copy culture)
- Build data moats (more data = better product)
- Continuous innovation (AI features, new portals)
- Strong brand (ethical automation, trust)

---

#### **Risk 3: AI Costs Spike** (MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Margin compression
**Mitigation**:
- Aggressive caching (60% cost reduction)
- Usage limits per tier (100 tailorings/month)
- Switch to cheaper models (Claude Haiku for simple tasks)
- Future: self-hosted LLMs (Llama 3, Mixtral)

---

#### **Risk 4: Slow User Growth** (MEDIUM)
**Impact**: Delayed profitability, runway concerns
**Mitigation**:
- Product Hunt launch (proven to work)
- Referral program (viral growth)
- Content marketing (SEO for "job tracker")
- Partnerships (career coaches, bootcamps)
- Paid ads (Google, Reddit) - $500/month budget

---
